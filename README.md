Welcome,

This is my part of my Full Stack Web Development course provided by Code Institute and Coleg Gwent. It may be sloppy, it may not have the best aesthetics, but we all started somewhere.

For further information on the course you can visit the Code Institute website here:

I am using GitPod and GitHub as my coding workspace and repository on this project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in GitPod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in GitPod with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In GitPod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

Happy coding!
